## How Snowflake Marketplace Works

The Marketplace leverages Snowflake's unique architecture to enable secure data sharing:

1. **Data Listing**: Providers publish data products to the Marketplace
2. **Discovery**: Consumers browse or search for relevant data
3. **Acquisition**: Consumers request access to the data
4. **Provider Approval**: For some listings, providers approve access requests
5. **Secure Access**: Data becomes available in the consumer's Snowflake account
6. **Integration**: Consumers can join marketplace data with internal data

!!! note "Zero-Copy Data Sharing"
    Snowflake's architecture allows for zero-copy data sharing, meaning data isn't duplicated when shared. This preserves storage efficiency and ensures consumers always access the latest version of the data.
